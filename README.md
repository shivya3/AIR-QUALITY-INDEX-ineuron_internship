# AIR-QUALITY-INDEX
-This repository contains code to predict the air quality based on the given parameters.

-With the help of this project we can detect the air quality.

# Purpose
Air pollution has become a serious environmental issue. It is responsible for hundreds of fatalities each year and it poses a serious threat to human health and environment. It leads to global warming, greenhouse effect and it also causes respiratory problems like asthma, lung cancer etc. It is important to predict the quality of the air to regulate air pollution. Air quality index (AQI) is a measure of air quality which describes the level of air pollution. Machine learning algorithms can help in predicting the AQI.
